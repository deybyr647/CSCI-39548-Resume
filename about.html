    <h1>Deyby Rodriguez</h1>
    <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

    <p>
      Hi there! My name is Deyby, and I'm from New York. I'm passionate about working with all things related to the
      web.
      Whether I'm working on a Front-End, a Back-End, or a REST API, I usually tend to have a good time!

      I'm currently studying Computer Science at CUNY Hunter College. Simultaneously, I'm also participating in a
      variety of
      external opportunities that focus on Computer Science. Some of these include Google's Code Next, and All Star
      Code, just
      to name a few. When I'm not busy with school or extracurriculars, I spend my spare time working on personal
      projects,
      listening to music, taking pictures, and biking.

      I'm always open to take on opportunities where I can not only use and improve my technical skills, but also meet
      other
      like-minded people who I can make great contributions to the world with.

      Aside from Full-Stack Web Development, I'm also interested in Computer Science Education, Data Analytics and the
      Finance
      industry.
